Prelim Project

🎉 **Calculator App Project (HTML, CSS, JS/TS)** 🎉

Good afternoon class! For your **Prelims Project**, 🖥️💻 we will be building a **simple calculator app** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript**. 

---

### 📋 **Functionalities to Implement:**
1. **Calculator Screen** 🖥️  
   - Displays results (no need for result history or chained operations).
  
2. **Keypad** 🔢  
   - Buttons for digits **0-9** and a **decimal point**.
  
3. **Operations** ➕➖✖️➗  
   - Basic math operations: **add, subtract, multiply, divide, and equals**.
  
4. **Special Buttons**:
   - **Backspace** ⬅️  
     - Delete last digit/operation.
   - **AC (All Clear)** 🧹  
     - Reset everything on the screen.
  
5. **Two Special Buttons**:
   - **Bye** 👋  
     - Turns off the calculator and shows "**Goodbye**" temporarily. (AC button will turn it back on)
   - **Hello** 🌎  
     - Randomly shows "**Hello**" in different languages (e.g., *Hola, Kamusta, etc*).

### 📝 **Important Notes**:
- **Limit the display** to prevent overflow (e.g., 8 characters).
- **Prevent invalid operations**, like double decimals or two operators in a row.
- **CSS is key!** 🎨 Make your calculator clean, neat, and responsive.
- Watch out for any **bugs or wacky issues** 🐛
